## What I learnt

This was the first week using Javascript, CSS and HTML all into a singular project. So I think the major thing I learnt was
how all the files interacted with each other and the use of Javascript to make a fully interactive page that people can
enjoy.

Furthermore, As it was the first time having to build something from scratch with all the components, time management was
a big factor as having problems within JavaScript would sometimes run over into the next document and you would have to rewrite
entire sections. This made me realise that I need to focus on the functionality over the style and how the website looks as when
taking this path lead me to be more successful and save time.

In addition, learning how JavaScript react with the page and testing all its functions that allow the developer to create a great experience
was really interesting. JavaScript has infinite possibilities and is only stopped by the developer's own thoughts which is amazing because
it made me appreciate that anything can be created, I just have to find the solution.

## Usage

A user is able to go onto the website and take a quiz to see how good there JavaScript knowledge is. After taking the quiz they will be put into a
scoreboard which is stored on local storage, so if another person decide to play on the same computer they will be able to see who is the most
knowledgable
